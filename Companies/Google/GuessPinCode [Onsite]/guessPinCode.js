/**
 * Given 2 strings pin and guess. Write a function to provide a hint that indicates how digits in guess match the pin.
 *
 * Use:
 *   * - to indicate a number in the correct possition.
 *   o - to indicate that a number is present in the pin code but in a different possition.
 *   _ - to indicate that there's no such number in the pin code.
 *
 *   Example 1:
 *   Input: pin = "1432", guess = "1246"
 *   Output: "*oo_"
 *
 *   Explanation:
 *   1 is in the correct position so `*`
 *   2 and 4 are present in the pin code but in different positions thus `oo`
 *   There's no 6 in the pin code thus `_`
 *
 *   Example 2:
 *   Input: pin = "1234", guess = "1234"
 *   Output: "****"
 *
 *   Example 3:
 *   Input: pin = "1234", guess = "5678"
 *   Output: "____"
 *
 *   Example 4:
 *   Input: pin = "1224", guess = "5242"
 *   Output: "_*oo"
 *
 *   Example 5:
 *   Input: pin = "1234", guess = "1224"
 *   Output: "**_*"
 *
 *   Example 6:
 *   Input: pin = "2124", guess = "1224"
 *   Output: "oo**"
 *
 *   Constraints:
 *   pin.length == input.length
 *   The input strings contain only digits 0-9.
