/**
 * A trapezoid is a 4-sided flat shape with straight sides that has a pair of opposite sides parallel.
 *
 * Question 1:
 *    Given an integer N which represents number of edges, where bases are always 2.
 *    Find how many trapezoid you can create with the integer N?
 *
 *    Hint:
 *    Use algorithmic approach to find solution, a count of possible trapezoid, don't have to use any mathematical formula (if you dont know)
 *
 *    E-g N =2 --> count = 1
 *    E-g N =3 --> count = 3
 *    E-g N =4 --> count = 6
 *
 * Question 2:
 *    Imagine now the N=4 and 2 of the edges are on the same line, how many trapezoid you can create with the integer N?
