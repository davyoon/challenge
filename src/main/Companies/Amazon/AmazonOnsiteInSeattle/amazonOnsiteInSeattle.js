 Amazon On-site in Seattle
 Every round has behavioral questions followed by tech questions.

 1st Round
 by interviewer and a shadow.
 Question: Compare two calendar dates (There is only Year/Month/Day in the given date stamp). It is a simple question
 but you’ll need to dig for further information from the discussion with interviewer.

 2nd Round
 by hiring manager.
 Question: Design parking lot. The interviewer asked me to draw the block diagram to show relations among objects.

 It seems weird to me as I doubt if the block diagram is expressive in the underlying relations. At last I just told
 him that I would be able to code the question, and drafted the data flow diagram instead of a block diagram.

 3rd Round
 by an interviewer
 Question: Assume that a video service calls a function every time someone watches a video. Build a function that
 returns the n most viewed videos an hour ago till now.

 I finished the code quickly with a O(nlogn) method. Interviewer asked for optimization but I wasn’t able to come
 up with it on the spot.

 4th Round
 by interviewer and a shadow.
 Question: Given water and island represented in a matrix. Find the size of the largest island. For example ‘X’
 is land and ‘O’ is water.
 XXOOOO
 XXXOOX
 OOXOOX
 XOOOOO
 Return 5 which is the size of the largest island (top left corner).

 Solved the problem with DFS. Was then asked for big O analysis.

 At last I was given the chance to asked a few questions. I asked 'What does the company culture contribute
 to the success of Amazon'. The interviewer said 'None'. I got wordless. Then with a 'I know what you are thinking' l
 ook, he said 'Amazon isn't like the labor factory what other people think it is. Work hours is from 10am to 5pm.
 Pretty regular if you finish the tasks properly'.
