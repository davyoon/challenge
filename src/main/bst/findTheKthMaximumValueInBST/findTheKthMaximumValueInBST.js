/**
 Find the Kth Maximum Value in a Binary Search Tree

 Implement a function findKthMax(root,k) which will take a BST and any number “k” as an input and return kth maximum number from that tree. Assume that “k” will always be less than or equal to the total number of nodes.

 Input #
 The root node for a binary search tree and any number k

 Output #
 Returns kth maximum value from the given tree

 Sample Input #
 bst = {
	6 -> 4,9
	4 -> 2,5
	9 -> 8,12
	12 -> 10,14
	}
 where parent -> leftChild,rightChild

 k = 3
 Sample Output #
 10
